## Command
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "delete" "Usage" false -->
Usage: kluctl delete [flags]

Delete a target (or parts of it) from the corresponding cluster
Objects are located based on the target discriminator.

WARNING: This command will also delete objects which are not part of your deployment
project (anymore). It really only decides based on the discriminator and does NOT
take the local target/state into account!
