If you are a DevOps engineer, SRA, a Homelab enthusiast or in any other comparable role that needs to manage Kubernetes
deployments, you'll probably have made the same journey that many others have gone. You started with plain YAML
manifests deployed via kubectl and eventually found out about Helm and Kustomize.

Whatever tool you decide to go for, the next realisation is usually that Helm and Kustomize itself need to be managed as
well. The naive solution is to create shell scripts that perform the required `helm install` and `helm upgrade` commands,
but these easily turn out to be unmanageable and quite limited.

There are multiple solutions available that allow you to manage your (and all third-party) Helm Charts and Kustomize
deployments. Examples are Flux, Argo CD, Helmfile and Kluctl. This blog post will concentrate on Kluctl and at the end
shortly compare it with the other options.

The final project that results from this post can be found in the
[kluctl-examples repository](https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl-examples/tree/main/blog/2023-02-28-managing-helm-with-kluctl).

## What to learn from this post?

I hope this post allows its readers to learn how easy it can be to manage multiple Helm Charts from one deployment
project while leveraging the following features and advantages of Kluctl:

1. Keep full control over deployment order (e.g. cert-manager after Cilium and apps after all base deployments)
2. Organise your deployment project in a way that feels natural (a straightforward folder structure)
3. Use the Kluctl CLI to diff and deploy and always be confident about the consequences of your deployment

## What to deploy?

We will deploy two categories of deployments. The first category is a collection of "base" deployments, namely the
following Helm Charts:

1. [Cilium](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium)
2. [cert-manager](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cert-manager/cert-manager)
3. [ingress-nginx](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx)

The second category contains "apps", or the [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) microservice to be
specific. It should be easy to apply the same ideas you learn in this post in case you want to add more apps to the
deployment.

The reason for this split is that it allows us to leverage Kluctl's abilities to do dependency management and ordered
deployments. It will also allow us to split up the project into multiple projects later (in a future blog post).

You might have noticed that we also deploy Cilium, which is usually unnecessary when deploying to a local cluster. I
decided to still do this in this tutorial, as I believe that we can learn a lot from this, especially in regard to
deployment order and dependency management (e.g., without a CNI, nothing else will work).

## Setting up a local cluster

We'll use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for the local cluster. As we need to disable a few things (CNI and kube-proxy),
and also expose some ports (for ingress-nginx), let's first create a proper kind configuration under `./kind-config.yaml`:

```yaml
# three node (two workers) cluster config
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    # this is required for ingress-nginx to work
    kubeadmConfigPatches:
      - |
        kind: InitConfiguration
        nodeRegistration:
          kubeletExtraArgs:
            node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
    extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 80
        hostPort: 8080
        listenAddress: 127.0.0.1
        protocol: TCP
      - containerPort: 443
        hostPort: 4443
        listenAddress: 127.0.0.1
        protocol: TCP
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
networking:
  # we use Cilium, so let's disable the default CNI
  disableDefaultCNI: true
  kubeProxyMode: none

```

Now let's create the kind cluster:

```shell
$ kind create cluster --name kluctl-tutorial --config kind-config.yaml
Creating cluster "kluctl-tutorial" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.25.3) üñº 
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶ üì¶ üì¶  
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú 
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è 
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ 
 ‚úì Joining worker nodes üöú 
Set kubectl context to "kind-kluctl-tutorial"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kluctl-tutorial

Thanks for using kind! üòä
```

If you check the PODs of the cluster now, you'll see:
```shell
$ kubectl get pod -A
kube-system          coredns-565d847f94-hcf4m                                0/1     Pending   0          4m37s
kube-system          coredns-565d847f94-md625                                0/1     Pending   0          4m37s
kube-system          etcd-kluctl-tutorial-control-plane                      1/1     Running   0          4m51s
kube-system          kube-apiserver-kluctl-tutorial-control-plane            1/1     Running   0          4m50s
kube-system          kube-controller-manager-kluctl-tutorial-control-plane   1/1     Running   0          4m51s
kube-system          kube-scheduler-kluctl-tutorial-control-plane            1/1     Running   0          4m51s
local-path-storage   local-path-provisioner-684f458cdd-zl8xj                 0/1     Pending   0          4m37s
```

Please note that multiple PODs are in pending state, which is because there is no CNI deployed. We'll fix this as the
first step now.

## Setting up the basic project structure

Let's first create some basic project structure. A Kluctl deployment project starts with a root
[deployment.yaml](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/deployments/deployment-yml/) which usually just includes more
[deployment projects](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/deployments/) and
[items](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/deployments/deployment-yml/#deployments).

A deployment item is a collection of Kubernetes manifests, either directly provided or generated from Kustomize or Helm.

Our root deployment yaml (`./deployment.yaml`) should look like this:

```yaml
deployments:
  - include: base
```

This tells Kluctl that a sub-deployment should be included from the path `./base`.

Now create `./base/deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
deployments:
  - path: cilium
```

This tells Kluctl that a deployment item at the location `./base/cilium` should be deployed. The referenced folder
can contain plain manifests, a [Kustomize deploymnet](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/deployments/kustomize/)
or a reference to a Helm Chart and the necessary Helm Values.

In this case, it will be a Helm Chart.

## Adding the first Helm Chart (Cilium)

A Helm based deployment item can be specified by putting a `helm-chart.yaml` file into the item's directory. This means,
we have to add `./base/cilium/helm-chart.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
helmChart:
  repo: https://helm.cilium.io/
  chartName: cilium
  chartVersion: 1.13.0
  skipPrePull: true
  releaseName: cilium
  namespace: "kube-system"
```

If you're used to Helm already, you'll probably recognise most of the parameters for the `helmChart` already. You
basically provide the repository URL, the chart name and version and some information about the release to be deployed.

The configuration/values for the Helm Release are passed via the `helm-values.yaml` file, which must be put along the
`helm-chart.yaml`, so it must be at `./base/cilium/helm-values.yaml`. For our Cilium inside Kind example, these are good
values:

```yaml
nodeinit:
  enabled: true
kubeProxyReplacement: strict
hostServices:
  enabled: false
externalIPs:
  enabled: true
nodePort:
  enabled: true
hostPort:
  enabled: true
bpf:
  masquerade: false
image:
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
ipam:
  mode: kubernetes

# See https://medium.com/@charled.breteche/kind-cluster-with-cilium-and-no-kube-proxy-c6f4d84b5a9d for details
k8sServiceHost: kluctl-tutorial-control-plane
k8sServicePort: 6443
```

The above values are loosely based on the [Kind cluster with Cilium and no kube-proxy](https://medium.com/@charled.breteche/kind-cluster-with-cilium-and-no-kube-proxy-c6f4d84b5a9d).

## Let's deploy it!

That's all we need for a working and minimalistic Kluctl deployment. Let's actually deploy it now (press `y` when asked!):

```shell
$ kluctl deploy
‚úì Loading kluctl project
‚úì Initializing k8s client
‚úì Rendering templates
‚úì Pulling Helm Chart cilium with version 1.13.0
‚úì Rendering Helm Charts
‚úì Building kustomize objects

‚ö† No discriminator configured for target, retrieval of remote objects will be slow.
‚úì Getting 16 additional remote objects
‚úì Getting namespaces
‚úì cilium: Applied 16 objects.
‚úì Running server-side apply for all objects

Warnings:

  kube-system/ServiceAccount/cilium-operator
? The diff succeeded, do you want to proceed? (y/N) y
‚úì cilium: Applied 16 objects.
‚úì Running server-side apply for all objects

New objects:

  kube-system/Secret/hubble-server-certs
  kube-system/Service/hubble-peer
  kube-system/ServiceAccount/cilium
  kube-system/ServiceAccount/cilium-operator
```

This should be pretty fast as it does not wait for readiness of Cilium. After a few seconds or minutes, you should see:

```shell
$ kubectl get pod -A 
NAMESPACE            NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

This shows us that the CNI has initialised properly and all PODs are running now.

## A few words about deployment order

I assume it's clear that whatever we're going to add to the deployment project from now on, must be deployed AFTER Cilium got
deployed. The reasons for this are simple: Nearly nothing can run without a CNI.

Deployment order is something that can be easily controlled in Kluctl deployment projects. By default, Kluctl deploys
all deployment items in parallel to get as much performance as possible. Consider the following example `deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
deployments:
  - path: a
  - path: b
  - path: c
```

This example will cause `a`, `b` and `c` to be deployed in parallel. If you want `b` and `c` to be deployed after `a`
has been deployed, simply put a [barrier](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/deployments/deployment-yml/#barriers)
between `a` and `b`:

```yaml
deployments:
  - path: a
  - barrier: true
  - path: b
  - path: c
```

This will cause Kluctl to stop and wait at the barrier and only continue when everything before (in this case just `a`)
got deployed. The same works with `include` and any other deployment item. We'll leverage the barriers in the next
section.

## Adding the cert-manager Helm Chart

Adding the [cert-manager](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cert-manager/cert-manager) Helm Chart is basically the same as we've
seen with the Cilium Helm Chart. Open the `./base/deployment.yaml` file and add a new deployment item:

```yaml
deployments:
  - path: cilium
  - barrier: true
  - path: cert-manager
```

The [barrier](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/deployments/deployment-yml/#barriers) is important here, as noted
in the previous section. It will ensure that all Cilium components are deployed before Kluctl continues with cert-manager.

Now, add `./base/cert-manager/helm-chart.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
helmChart:
  repo: https://charts.jetstack.io
  chartName: cert-manager
  chartVersion: v1.11.0
  releaseName: cert-manager
  namespace: "kube-system"
  skipPrePull: true
```

cert-manager is a little special when it comes to installing the CRDs. It skips doing this by default and thus
requires the following `./base/cert-manager/helm-values.yaml`:

```yaml
installCRDs: true
```

## Deploy it again

Now perform another deployment. You'll notice that it will first show you what will change and then ask for
confirmation again. Press `y` when asked for confirmation:

```shell
$ kluctl deploy
‚úì Loading kluctl project
‚úì Initializing k8s client
‚úì Rendering templates
‚úì Pulling Helm Chart cilium with version 1.13.0
‚úì Rendering Helm Charts
‚úì Building kustomize objects
‚úì Postprocessing objects
‚ö† No discriminator configured. Orphan object detection will not work
‚ö† No discriminator configured for target, retrieval of remote objects will be slow.
‚úì Getting 67 additional remote objects
‚úì Getting namespaces
‚úì cilium: Applied 18 objects.
‚úì Finished waiting
‚úì cert-manager: Applied 49 objects. Applied 4 hooks.
‚úì Running server-side apply for all objects

Warnings:
  no discriminator configured. Orphan object detection will not work

New objects:
  ClusterRole/cert-manager-cainjector
  ...snip...
  kube-system/ServiceAccount/cert-manager-webhook

Applied hooks:
  kube-system/ServiceAccount/cert-manager-startupapicheck
  kube-system/Role/cert-manager-startupapicheck:create-cert
  kube-system/RoleBinding/cert-manager-startupapicheck:create-cert
  kube-system/Job/cert-manager-startupapicheck
? The diff succeeded, do you want to proceed? (y/N) y
‚úì cilium: Applied 18 objects.
‚úì Finished waiting
‚úì cert-manager: Applied 49 objects. Applied 4 hooks. Deleted 4 hooks.
‚úì Running server-side apply for all objects

New objects:
  ClusterRole/cert-manager-cainjector
  ...snip...
  kube-system/ServiceAccount/cert-manager-webhook

Applied hooks:
  kube-system/ServiceAccount/cert-manager-startupapicheck
  kube-system/Role/cert-manager-startupapicheck:create-cert
  kube-system/RoleBinding/cert-manager-startupapicheck:create-cert
  kube-system/Job/cert-manager-startupapicheck
```

After a few seconds or minutes you should see cert-manager up and running in your cluster. We won't further use
cert-manager as it would be out of scope for this tutorial. I assume you can imagine how you would proceed with
deployments that need to create cert-manager issuers and certificates (you'd use barriers and an appropriate project
structure).

## Add the ingress-nginx Helm Chart

Now let's add the [ingress-nginx](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx) Helm Chart. It's
important that you have used the kind configuration specified [here](#setting-up-a-local-cluster), as otherwise the
ingress controller won't be accessible from your machine.

First, update `./base/deployment.yaml` to include two new deployment items:

```yaml
deployments:
  - path: namespaces
  - barrier: true
  - path: cilium
  - barrier: true
  - path: cert-manager
  - path: ingress-nginx
    waitReadiness: true
```

The first new deployment item is `namespaces`, which should contain a single file named `ingress-nginx.yaml` with the
following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ingress-nginx
```

This deployment item and the barrier entry ensure that the required `ingress-nginx` namespace is created before we try
to deploy the `ingress-nginx` Helm Chart. This is a pattern that you'll encounter in nearly all Kluctl based
deployments. It is also one of the best and easiest examples why ordering is important: You can't deploy namespaced
objects before the target namespace is deployed.

Next, create the file `./base/ingress-nginx/helm-chart.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
helmChart:
  repo: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
  chartName: ingress-nginx
  # Please don't try to manually upgrade this to the latest version yet. We will use this to demonstrate an upgrade later!
  chartVersion: 4.5.0
  skipPrePull: true
  releaseName: ingress-nginx
  namespace: ingress-nginx
```

For `./base/ingress-nginx/helm-values.yaml`, you must use:

```yaml
controller:
  hostNetwork: true
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
  nodeSelector:
    ingress-ready: "true"
  tolerations:
    - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  updateStrategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate
```

This configuration ensures that the ingress controller runs on the control-plane nodes and uses the host network of
these. The `extraPortMappings` of the [kind configuration](#setting-up-a-local-cluster) will then allow you to access
the ingress controller via localhost, or via `http://my-ingress.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080` (see https://nip.io).

The `waitReadiness: true` in the `deployment.yaml` means that Kluctl should not just deploy the resources of the
deployment item, but also wait for [readiness](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/deployments/readiness/) of
each resource.

## Deploy it again

Simply run `kluctl deploy` again and confirm it with `y`. You should see how Kluctl deploys all resources, runs
[hooks](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/deployments/hooks/) and waits for readiness.

## Add the podinfo application

We now have a somewhat functional cluster up and running locally. We can now also deploy the podinfo Helm Chart and
expose it via ingress-nginx.

Let's however first extend the project structure a bit. Edit the root deployment at `./deployment.yaml` and change it to:

```yaml
deployments:
  - include: base
  - barrier: true
  - include: apps
```

This will ensure that everything from `base` is deployed before it starts to deploy anything from `apps`. The `apps`
sub-deployment can now be used to deploy all kinds of apps, for example the [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo)
"microservice".

Now create the file `./apps/deployment.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
deployments:
  - path: podinfo
```

And `./apps/podinfo/helm-chart.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
helmChart:
  repo: oci://ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo
  chartVersion: 6.3.4
  releaseName: podinfo
  namespace: "podinfo"
  skipPrePull: true
```

This time, we will create the necessary namespace in the same deployment item as the Helm Chart itself. This can be
accomplished by adding a `./apps/podinfo/kustomization.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
resources:
  - namespace.yaml
  - helm-rendered.yaml
  - ingress.yaml
```

Kluctl will respect the order of resources found in Kustomize deployments, and thus deploy the namespace before anything else.
The `helm-rendered.yaml` is an auto-generated file containing the templated Helm Chart, this file however will never physically
appear in your project.

To add an ingress, add `./apps/podinfo/ingress.yaml` (which is also specified in the `kustomization.yaml`) with the
following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: podinfo
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: podinfo.127.0.0.1.nip.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: podinfo
                port:
                  number: 9898
```

The above ingress uses the previously deployed ingress-nginx controller with the class name `nginx`. We use
[nip.io](https://nip.io) to get a simple dummy domain name for the ingress. This domain will resolve to 127.0.0.1 and
thus let you access the ingress through the `extraPortMappings` of the [kind cluster](#setting-up-a-local-cluster).

## Deploy podinfo

Now run `kluctl deploy` again and wait for it to finish. Also wait for all PODs to become ready in the cluster and then
try to access podinfo by opening http://podinfo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/ in your browser.

You should be greeted by this sweet little fellow :) 

![](/images/blog/2023-02-28-managing-helm-with-kluctl-podinfo.png)

## Tabula Rasa

Now let's prove that the order of deployments was actually honored. Right now, you have added new stuff incrementally,
so in theory the deployment could be in a state where it just worked by accident. We however want to make sure and prove
that the whole deployment can be performed in one go.

Let's delete the kind cluster, re-create it and then re-deploy:

```shell
$ kind delete cluster --name kluctl-tutorial
$ kind create cluster --name kluctl-tutorial --config kind-config.yaml
$ kluctl deploy
```

Things should be up and running again after a few minutes, without the need to retry the deployment.

## Upgrade the ingress-nginx Helm Chart

If you look at `./base/ingress-nginx/helm-chart.yaml` again, you'll see that version `4.5.0` was used. This version is
already outdated and should be upgraded. Simply change the version to `4.5.2` and then run `kluctl deploy` again.

When you do this, Kluctl will first perform a dry-run and then print a diff that shows you what would happen if you confirm
the deployment. The changes seen in the diff should look like this:

```shell
$ kluctl deploy
‚úì Loading kluctl project
...snip...
‚úì Running server-side apply for all objects

Warnings:
  no discriminator configured. Orphan object detection will not work

Changed objects:

? The diff succeeded, do you want to proceed? (y/N) 
```

If you confirm the deployment, it will apply the changes seen before.

## Templating and Kluctl Targets

What you have seen so far is just showcasing how Kluctl deployment projects are structured and how Helm is integrated.
This alone is already very powerful, as it allows you to structure large and complex deployments in a way that mirrors
your intent, without too much complexity or boilerplate.

The next step would be to introduce [templating](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/templating/) and
[Kluctl targets](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/kluctl-project/targets/). This will then allow you to make
your deployment multi-environment and multi-cluster capable.

These topics will however require another post, as it would be too much to be covered in this post as well.

## GitOps with Kluctl

This post has shown the "push" flow of Kluctl by simply calling Kluctl from your local machine. The same flow can be
adapted to a pipeline based CI/CD system, e.g. Github Actions or Gitlab CI.

Kluctl also offers a pull based flow, implemented through the [Kluctl controller](https://kluctl.io/docs/flux/)
(GitHub repository is located [here](https://github.com/kluctl/flux-kluctl-controller)). This is comparable to how Flux
does it, you deploy a `KluctlDeployment` custom resource and the controller handles reconciliation via periodic
deployments.

## Kluctl vs Flux/ArgoCD/Helmfile

As mentioned at the top of this post, there are multiple solutions available that can all be used to tackle the same set
of problems. All of these do it with different approaches and I will try to compare these approaches with the way Kluctl
does it.

### Flux

[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) allows to define [Kustomizations](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/)
and [HelmReleases](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/helm/helmreleases/), which are both
[Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).
These Custom Resources are then handled by different Flux Controllers which perform the actual reconciliation.

This in turn means that you make yourself dependent on the Custom Resources being applied on the cluster and the
controller processing them. This also means, you can't easily try out things locally, as the only available command to
do this is [flux diff kustomization](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cmd/flux_diff_kustomization/) which is much harder to use
then [kluctl diff](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/commands/diff/) and unable to handle Helm Charts.

You will also never be able to mix GitOps with non-GitOps flows, e.g. "deploy from your laptop" for development
environments and GitOps for "real" environments. Being able to mix these flows would allow you to move extremely fast
while testing out and researching new stuff, without the need to constantly push to Git and then wait for the
reconciliation to succeed/fail.

Dependency management in Flux is handled via [dependsOn](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#kustomization-dependencies)
fields, which can however [not be mixed](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/1599) with different resource types.

### ArgoCD

I'm not very experienced with [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), so take my words with a grain of
salt. But from everything I've seen so far, the same things I wrote about Flux also apply to ArgoCD. The biggest
difference is that you have a UI that visualises changes and drift.

Dependency management is handled via [Sync Waves](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/),
which allows you to give resources a priority which is then used to determine deployment order.

### Helmfile

[Helmfile](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is probably the tool that can be best compared to Kluctl. There
are however some important differences. Helmfile concentrates on Helm as being the underlying building block for
all deployments. This means, it will internally convert plain manifests and Kustomize deployments into Helm Charts
and install them via the Helm CLI.

Kluctl on the other hand uses Kustomize as the base building block and instead converts Helm Charts into Kustomize
deployments by simply rendering the Charts. This also means, that Kluctl will not use `helm install` but instead rely
on its own server-side-apply based implementation, giving it much better conflict detection, conflict resolution and
diffing capabilities.

Helmfile currently has no GitOps style controller available. From what I can find online, people tend to use
`helmfile template` to simply generate plain manifests which they then commit and push to Git.

## What next?

The project that we created in this post is only partially useful, as it is not ready for multi-environment and
multi-cluster deployments. In an upcoming post, I will describe how to add
[targets](https://kluctl.io/docs/kluctl/reference/kluctl-project/targets/) and use templating to allow different
flavors to be deployed. I will also describe how to properly split up projects, for example so that you have a
cluster-base deployment with Cilium and ingress-nginx and multiple application specific deployments.
